Project Description

Meeting Minder is a project aimed at optimizing the efforts and gains that go into summarizing professional discussions during virtual meetings. The project addresses common issues faced by attendees of virtual meetings, such as distractions, technical problems, and information overload. By converting speech data into summarized textual data using AI/ML and deep learning techniques, Meeting Minder simplifies the process and increases efficiency.

Problem/Need

- Attendees may get distracted during virtual meetings, making it challenging to take notes.
- Technical issues like poor internet connectivity can disrupt meetings.
- Attendees miss non-verbal cues in virtual meetings.
- Meetings provide a lot of information in a brief period, leading to information overload.
- Back-to-back meetings leave little time to compile comprehensive notes.
- Taking notes during sensitive discussions can raise privacy concerns.

 Purpose and Necessity

- Effective Communication: Good note-taking helps participants understand and retain meeting information.
- Enhanced Collaboration: Detailed notes aid collaboration and ensure everyone is on the same page.
- Accountability: Notes are crucial for tracking progress and resolving disputes.
- Time Efficiency: Well-organized notes save time and lead to more productive discussions.
- Professionalism: Taking careful notes demonstrates professionalism and respect for colleagues.
- Legal and Compliance: Accurate meeting records are necessary for legal and compliance purposes.
- Decision-Making: Good notes are essential for informed decision-making.
- Continuous Improvement: Reviewing meeting notes identifies areas for improvement.

Project Plan/Flow:
Our project involves the following stages:

1. Project Planning and Requirements Gathering: Gather necessary data and define project tasks.
2. Design of Browser Extension: Design the user interface for the browser extension and plan system architecture.
3. Speech Recording and Storage: Set up a user interface for recording speech and save it securely.
4. Speech-to-Text Conversion: Integrate a speech-to-text API to transcribe recorded speech into text.
5. Text Summarization: Process text data using deep learning to create concise summaries.
6. Integration with Email Services: Configure email server settings and develop email-sending functionality.
7. Final Presentation and Demonstration: Create a presentation showcasing the extension's features.

Outcomes:
Our project will deliver a functional browser extension for recording, summarizing, and emailing meeting minutes. The outcomes include:

- Efficient meeting management with automatic speech-to-text transcription.
- Enhanced user experience with concise meeting summaries.
- Improved accessibility for individuals with note-taking challenges.
- Time savings for users, allowing them to focus on critical tasks.
- Potential for commercialization and contributions to research in summarization.

Team Responsibilities:

- Keerthana Amalanathan Valarmathi: Project planning, text summarization model building, weekly report submission.
- Priyanka Kothapalli: Design of browser extension, text summarization model building, weekly report creation.
- Thirumalan Sathananthan: Speech recording and storage, text summarization model building, final presentation and demonstration.
- Sai Kiran Pilli: Speech-to-text conversion, text summarization model building, final presentation and demonstration.
- Ashok Kumar: Integration with email services, text summarization model building, final presentation and demonstration.

Evaluation:
Our project's evaluation includes automated and manual methods:

Automatic Evaluation: We will assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the conversion and summarization process, measuring the speed and accuracy of text conversion.

Manual Evaluation: Usability testing with real users will be conducted to evaluate installation simplicity, user interface design, and overall user experience. Development testing using web browsers and user satisfaction surveys will also be used to assess the extension's performance.
